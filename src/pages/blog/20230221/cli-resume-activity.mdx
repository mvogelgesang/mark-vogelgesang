*This is the first of what I hope to be many 'Tiny Example' posts where I describe the implementation details of a discreet piece of functionality. The Tiny Examples grew out of a desire to to better understand specific coding concepts and patterns. Existing examples can be found on GitHub at [mvogelgesang/tiny-examples](https://github.com/mvogelgesang/tiny-examples).*

In many instances, CLI operations return results or execute a task rather quickly. However, ther are times when operations may have to iterate through a list of files, sync data, or make a series of API calls. In these instances, it can be helpful to pause operations and later resume the job. This _Tiny Example_ prototypes start, stop, and resume functionality using an oclif-based CLI. 

## Getting started

This _Tiny Example_ is built using [oclif](https://oclif.io/) which is an open source CLI framework maintained by Salesforce. To get up and running quickly, we leverage the starter code produced by `npx oclif generate myexamplecli` which creates a simple CLI with a `hello` command. Later on, we will add a new command, `hello everyone` which iterates over a list of names printing `hello {name}` to the console. Between each print to the console, the CLI pauses for one second. 

## Considerations

- Needs to save state in a place that will persist between runs
- After each iteration, state should update
- If previous state does not exist, should run without issue
- Should have the ability to restart the operation entirely and ignore the previously saved state

## About oclif Hooks

oclif offers a hook framework allowing the injection of code at various stages of the command lifecycle. Four lifecycle events are included (source [oclif Hooks](https://oclif.io/docs/hooks#lifecycle-events)):

- `init` - runs when the CLI is initialized before a command is found to run
- `prerun` - runs after `init` and after the command is found, but just before running the command itself
- `postrun` - runs after the command only if the command finishes with no error
- `command_not_found` - runs if a command is not found before the error is displayed

These are great for times when you want to run an action with every command in your CLI- think checking for updates, ensuring config is set, etc. However, this example seeks to apply hooks only on a specific command and will leverage custom hooks. Hooks take any string value as their name. Three distinct hooks are required: create, retrieve, and update. Prefixing each file with "state-manager" ensured the hooks were easy to identify and reference. 

## Putting it together

At a high level, the following steps will need to be coded for this to work.

Iterate over list, updating after each iteration until list length = 0. If resume flag is not set, create a new list and store in cache. Iterate over list, updating after each iteration until list length = 0." style="max-height: unset; width: unset;"

The new `hello everyone` command and three hooks can be scaffolded via:

```sh
oclif generate command hello:everyone
oclif generate hook state-manager:create
oclif generate hook state-manager:retrieve
oclif generate hook state-manager:update
```

After producing the initial working version, I removed the hard-coded reference to the file name and passed it into each hook as a variable. Doing so enables this hook structure to be used elsewhere in the application.

### Hook create

In order to save a local copy of the list between runs, we make use of the [cache directory](https://oclif.io/docs/config) which is automatically configured with oclif. Doing so keeps it out of the way of our repository files and enables users to customize it if necessary.

Since this is a simple list of names, we can save the file as JSON.

### Hook retrieve

The retrieve hook returns an array whether there is a list of names or not. The underlying function is placed in `helper.ts` since I also use it in the update hook.

### Hook update

The update hook reads in the file, extracts the array, drops the first element from the array, and writes the resulting array back to disk.

## Running it

```sh
yarn run prepack
bin/run hello everyone
```

Names will print each second. Break the loop with `ctrl+c`. Resume the operation by adding the `-r` flag.

```sh
bin/run hello everyone -r
```
