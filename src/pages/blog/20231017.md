title: "Salesforce Developers Blog: Build Lightning Web Components Faster with Code Snippets"
tags: ["salesforce", "lightning web components", "lwc"]
description: "Implementing Salesforce Base Lightning Web Components just got easier with the addition of HTML Code Snippets in the Salesforce Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code. By using Code Snippets, developers will no longer forget a property, misspell a component name, or leave out ARIA elements.

This post will explain what Code Snippets are, how to use them, and how you can build your own for your project."
