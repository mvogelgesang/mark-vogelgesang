Last fall, I had an opportunity to take a course from _The Economist_ called
"Business Writing and Storytelling". It all came about one day on a team call
where my manager, Ana, told us of the course. We had previously discussed _The
Economist's_ [Big Mac Index](https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index) and cited
it as an effective way to share complex information. In our work, we found that
the digital fluencey of our audience varied greatly and we needed to get better
at speaking to folks with a range of skill levels. What better way than to learn
from a publication that is both nuanced and approachable?

Within each week's cirriculum, there was a mixture of written lessons, articles,
and videos. The videos were recorded by various editors and contributors from
the magazine. The individuals offered a wide range of techniques and approaches
to getting words on paper. For instance, the science editor, Alok Jha, faces
different challenges compared to his economics and finance counterparts when
writing a story. As a result, he works to keep the scientific facts relevant to
the broader economic picture. Similarly, other editors cited that the best
writing is often the easiest to read. That is, the point is conveyed clearly and
is not hidden behind fancy words or embellished prose.

The written assignments and associated feedback was the most valuable part of
the course. Rather than being particularly concerned with the subject, the
editors sought clarity in what was being said. Often, the comments would come
back to say, "you can say this with less words" or "break that thought apart".
In doing so, I was able to take a rather weedsy topic and distill it into points
that made sense to a wide audience. This type of feedback and instruction was at
the heart of the course- say what it is you want to say with clarity.

To wrap up, editing ones own work requires strong focus on what it is you are
trying to say. All too often, I find myself, even when writing this, straying
away from the main points. Taking this course has helped develop new skills to
get my ideas down on paper and pare them back later. For folks looking to
enhance their writing skills, I would strongly recommend the course. Overall, it
is six weeks long, takes place completely online, and requires six to ten hours
of commitment per week. Each week, written assignments are due and build upon
one another into a larger paper of roughly 1,200 words.
