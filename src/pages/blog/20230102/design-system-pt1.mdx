  "Previous iterations of my site leveraged SASS but the patterns were thrown
  together and lacked consistency. My recent introduction of a dark mode exposed
  many inconsistencies in the original setup. Rather than putting band-aids on
  the styles, I wanted to push in the direction of a design system, but how?"

Over the holidays, I spent some time switching the site from Gatsby to Astro and
add a dark mode toggle (see <i class="fas fa-adjust"></i> above). The switch was
fairly straightforward and resulted in a codebase that will be easier to
maintain. In the process of implementing the dark mode toggle, I found
inconsistencies with my original SASS which made the conversion harder than it
had to be. In response, I wanted to create something that was easier to extend
while also looking less thrown together. This post will cover the visual design
choices for the site including an 8pt grid, color swatches, and site typography.
I hesitate to call it a "design-system" but these are some baby steps in that
direction.

## Principles

I have used both mature and project-specific design systems in the past but had
never been involved in the early stages. Before I started creating any visual
designs, research was required to learn how a design-system comes together.
Going into the research phase, I laid out a few key factors that were important
to my site:

1. **Readability** - The primary reason for the site is to publish content. Font
   choice, line height, and line length are important factors to ensure folks
   can focus on the content rather than getting lost in the layout.
1. **Pattern-based** - I am not a visual designer by trade, if there are
   patterns or rules I can follow to make color or visual design decisions, I am
   game.
1. **Extendable** - Over time, I will want to add new components and features.
   Whatever solution I choose should enable me to build the new stuff in a
   simplified way.

## Research

With the principles in place, I started searching for blog posts or
implementation guidance for large scale design systems. Many blogs cited
[Atlassian](https://atlassian.design),
[Google Material](https://m3.material.io/styles), and
[IBM's Carbon](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/)
design system documentation. I found Atlassian and IBM's documentation to be
quite consumable and explained both the theory and practice of implementing a
design system.

The more I read about design systems, the more I saw mentions of using an 8pt
grid system which was a new concept to me. Both IBM and Atlassian utilize 8pt
grids as cornerstones to their designs. In addition to reading their content, I
found a series of Medium posts by Vitsky where they discuss the topic and
provide examples in Figma. Both links are member-only Medium posts:
[Design System based on the 8pt Grid](https://medium.com/@VitskyDS/design-system-based-on-the-8pt-grid-2473ca5f0ae1)
and
[The Comprehensive 8pt Grid Guide](https://medium.com/swlh/the-comprehensive-8pt-grid-guide-aa16ff402179).

With a conceptual understanding of the 8pt grid system, I decided to tackle
typography and colors first. Subsequent articles will be written about the
larger layout grid system and how components fit into it.

## Putting It Together

### Typography

The existing site leverages Montserrat but the font sizing, line height, and
weight lacked a coherent strategy beyond h1 being larger than h2 and so on.
Following many of the principles of the 8pt grid, I adjusted font sizes and line
heights of each major element. To do so, I leveraged Montserrat in various
weights and sizes.

### Colors

I liked many of the colors used on the current site and wanted to use those as
starting points. Atlassian uses 10 or more swatches per palette which
conveniently enables symmetrical colors when switching between
[light and dark modes](https://atlassian.design/foundations/color-new/color-palette-new/#picking-colors-for-dark-mode).
Per their example, a 10 swatch palette creates natural color pairs which offer
light/dark mode equivalents. To start, I picked three colors which produced 30
total swatches.

#### Starting Colors

<div style="display:flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  {startingColors.map((item) => {
    return <Swatch hexValue={item.hex} colorName={item.value} />;
  })}
</div>

#### Swatches

##### Neutral

<div style="display:flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  {neutral.map((item) => {
    return <Swatch hexValue={item.hex} colorName={"neutral" + item.value} />;
  })}
</div>

##### Green

<div style="display:flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  {green.map((item) => {
    return <Swatch hexValue={item.hex} colorName={"green" + item.value} />;
  })}
</div>

##### Aqua

<div style="display:flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  {aqua.map((item) => {
    return <Swatch hexValue={item.hex} colorName={"aqua" + item.value} />;
  })}
</div>

## What's Next

As it stands, the switch to color swatches and typography settings are
incomplete and the SASS files are a mix between the old and new. A subsequent
update using design tokens should make the switch complete. In subsequent
updates, I hope to address the following:

- Design tokens
- Content grid
- Accessibility
- Theming
- Components (GitHub/Gist embed, inline code, block quotes, tables)
- Elevation/ shadows
- Animations
