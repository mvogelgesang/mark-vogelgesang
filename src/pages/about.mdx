Iâ€™m Mark and here you will find the occasional musing about my work, scripts to
make life easier, ongoing development projects, and other areas of interest.

I currently work at Salesforce as a Principal ISV Platform Expert where I
support ISV and OEM partners with Data Cloud, Lightning Web Components, and packaging.
